1,5,3,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,3,5,2,HoloLens for sure. It was way easier to navigate around in it and looking at/comparing the sizes of the visualizations was easier. ,"The computer. Because we count point at the screen effectively, but using the HoloLens the other person can't really see our hand or our pointer."
2,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,HoloLens (it was fun),"I would say communicating with computer was super easy. But in case of hololens, for few questions(network graph questions) it was a bit difficult to follow what the other person is saying and trace the exact node my team member is talking about. Other than that it was easy to communicate."
3,7,5,4,5,5,5,6,5,7,4,5,6,"the hololens. even though i had some user issues getting it started, it was much easier to view the graphs in 3d compared to on a computer screen","easier to communicate while using the hololens. we couldn't see what each other was pointing at in virtual reality, but being able to describe things and walk around made the communication aspect much better"
4,6,3,4,4,6,3,5,3,6,3,5,4,"HOLOLENS, IT WAS FUN AND GAVE MORE VIEWS OF THE GRAPHS","HOLOLENS, WE COULD SEE THE VIEWS AT BETTER ANGLES, AND IT WAS FUN"
5,2,3,1,4,7,3,6,5,7,6,7,6,"Hololens, because it was easier to navigate in three directions.","computer, because in hololens it was hard to know we were looking at the same point when we couldn't reach out and point clearly."
6,5,3,1,4,4,4,2,1,5,3,1,1,I liked having the HoloLens because I was able to maneuver around it more to see all angles a lot better than the actual computer.,It was pretty equal regarding communication.
7,7,4,4,6,6,4,6,2,6,3,6,5,HoloLens,"The computer, I really wish we could have seen each other's HoloLens pointers in the simulation to be more precise in our discussion. With the computer we could actually see the same thing and the pointer."
8,4,2,4,2,5,2,2,6,6,3,7,2,preferred the headset because it was much easier to move around and see the graphs in more detail. ,It was a little easier to communicate using the computer because with the headset our graphs are placed in different areas so its hard to show the partner what you are looking at. 
9,7,5,7,4,4,4,7,4,7,5,7,3,HoloLens,"Computer, could not see his hand in HoloLens and where he was pointing"
10,6,2,3,5,4,4,2,1,5,3,6,2,the hololens was much more engaging,it was easier with the hololens because you could point to things much easier
11,4,4,1,2,4,4,2,2,6,2,5,1,HOLOLENS. tHE ABILITY TO WALK AROUND THE CHARTS AND SEE MORE PERSPECTIVES,HOLOLENS.  WE BOTH COULD CLEARLY SEE THE CHART FROM THE SAME PERSPECTIVES.  DEPTH WAS EASIER TO SEE.
12,6,4,1,3,7,5,3,6,7,4,7,2,"two, it was easier to interact with the system on the Hololens than the computer","one, we were able to interact more and show the points more specifically than space"
13,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,1,1,"The HoloLens is very intuitive to use, but it requires full movement of the body. The computer requires some finesse with the mouse but requires basically no physical energy. I personally prefer the HoloLens as it requires no thought in manipulating the view of graphs.","With the computer, it was easier to point out a specific point as we were both looking at the same screen."
14,4,5,1,3,4,4,5,4,3,5,5,2,"It depended a lot on the task that I had to perform. For analyzing the network chart, it was much much easier to use a computer since it was a bit difficult to coordinate with my teammate. Since it is not possible to coordinate while using hololens, therefore computer is my preferred device. However, Hololens was much much fun to use and it kept me engaged while using desktop was a bit boring.",It was extremely easy to use computer to coordinate with my teammate. Using hololens made it difficult for me to coordinate with my teammate.
15,6,3,3,3,3,4,3,6,6,3,6,3,Hololens because it was easier to look around and you easily control what part of the graph you wanted to see,The computer because we could see the same thing and physically show where we were looking at 
16,4,5,1,2,1,1,4,3,4,4,1,1,"Hololens, it was easier to view it from different angles.",Communication was the same.
17,6,5,1,1,4,5,5,5,6,3,5,2,"HoloLens, it was easier to navigate the 3D models, and moving around was easier than trying to use the mouse.","HoloLens. We could both work on something at the same time, getting two viewpoints and then combining what we saw to get our answer. The computer was easier to see the same thing, but felt like we were missing something."
18,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,"I preferred the HoloLens, as felt I could get a better understanding of the 3d models ","yes it was super easy to communicate with my teammate, as they were open minded yet still willing to contribute their ideas! we formulated our final answers on the graph by bouncing off each others ideas until we came to an agreement! overall great experience!"
19,7,4,3,6,4,4,2,6,7,6,7,2,"HoloLens. For this specific task of visualization, the HoloLens offers greater flexibility (way better) than the computer mouse. Specifically for the scatter plot and network plot, a 3D presentation is easier to manipulate. ","Computer is easier to communicate locations of objects we were specifying because there is little room for ambiguation on a 2D plane. The HoloLens takes a while to get used to, we overtime we learned to communicate via the colors of the axis. Specifying the exact location with HoloLens, with the habit of pointing with fingers, was harder than using a computer"
20,6,4,2,3,5,4,4,2,5,3,5,2,"The HoloLens was easier to use, both because the controls were easier, and it was easier to see points in 3d. It also allowed both teammates to see sperate view so we could split up tasks sometimes and compare results. Overall the HoloLens was easier to use and improved performance. ",The computer was easier in some regards as we could precisely highlight a point with the cursor. The hololens did not have this ability so we were forced to try to point with hands which was sometimes to slightly different points. But still  think the hololens was easier to communicate with because it increased the amount of verbal communication and allowed us to have separate view of the data.
